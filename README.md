# CapuCosmetics
A mod for "Capuchin" that allows users to load custom cosmetics into the game!

## Dependencies
* [BepInEx6](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v6.0.0-pre.2/BepInEx-Unity.IL2CPP-win-x64-6.0.0-pre.2.zip)
* [Newtonsoft.Json](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/releases/download/13.0.3/Json130r3.zip)

## Installation
* Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/arielthemonke/CapuCosmetics/releases/latest) and put it in your plugins folder(I suggest creating a dedicated folder for it)
* Get the [Newtonsoft.Json](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/releases/download/13.0.3/Json130r3.zip) zip and extract it.
* in the netstandard2.0 folder you will see `Newtonsoft.Json.dll`, put that in your plugins as well.
* Run your game once.
* CapuCosmetics will automatically create a new folder called `Cosmetics`, all files that have the `.capucosmetic` extension should be in there.
* thats it, after installing some cosmetics you can open your game and you should have them!
